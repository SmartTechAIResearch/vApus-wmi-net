Like vApus-wmi but strictly in dotnet 4.5 instead of java 6 with a bridge to dotnet for accessing Windows Instrumentation.

Not derived from the vApus-agent base classes, since those are java, but simular to it and uses the same communication protocol. See the vApus-agent readme for a description of that.

The AssemblyFileVersion should be updated each time a new version is released.
